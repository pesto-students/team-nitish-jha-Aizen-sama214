# Protocol stack and its relevance in Web Development

Modern internet is built on broadly 4 different laters or protocols built on top of each other.

- Link Layer : This is the physical layer that is responsible for physical transporatation of information on netwroks. Ethernet and Wi-fi protocols belong to this layer.
- Network Layer : This layer is responsible for locating a network device. Each device has an IP (Internet Prootocol) address and each packet of information uses IP address to traverse from origin to destination.
- Transport Layer: This layer is reponsible for breaking down of information into small packets and also making sure reliable transportation of data packets on the network. Protocols such as TCP and UDP are different protocols used in this layer.
- Application layer- This is the top most layer that end users of internet are most familiar with. End users can interact with world wide web using the applications built in this layer and all these applications use http or https protocols to communicate with each other.

Web development is mostly concerned with the application layer. We use http protocol to send and trasmit data such as html files over the world wide web. So its important for developers to understand how this layer works in order to implement programs with diverse functionalities which as reliable and robust.
